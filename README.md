#  ðŸ˜‡ Purity RiGO CS:GO Utils
~~Undetected for 7 months (as of 12/05/2021)~~
As I quit playing CS:GO a long time ago & there is no reason for this to sit private, I have now decided to publicize this repository. As the line above suggests, this project was "*undetected*" for around 7 months. After that, I quit playing the game, and thus I have no idea how long it truly lasted. 

## Purity: RiGO External
This project was my 2nd time working on a game "*utility*" tool. And one of my earlier projects (this was made in 2020). I wouldn't recommend using this as a base. My way of doing things and the way my code looks is just plain bad. If anything, use this as an example of what **not** to do. 

Purity: RiGO was a simple external C# utility tool for the popular game "Counter-Strike: Global Offensive". It included a Glow ESP and No-Flash. Both were done by writing memory to their corresponding [netvar](https://developer.valvesoftware.com/wiki/Networking_Entities). 

From what I know, as of the 3rd of February 2022 CS:GO got updated with some new detection methods. They seem to now check if netvars have been written to, and if so, your trust factor will most likely drop. VALVe don't seem to be banning people for just having patched netvars. 

VAC (CS:GO their Anti-Cheat) is honestly a joke. If you're looking to get into making game cheats, I'd recommend you check out [Guided Hacking](https://guidedhacking.com/). While there are other communities out there where you can learn Game Hacking, most are a toxic cesspool full of misinformation and disrespect.
